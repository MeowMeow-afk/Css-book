## The blury effect

Here i have created a blury effect inside a form container
using css property backdrop-filter and value blur().

At the time of creation of this repo this feature is not suported in firefox ðŸ˜­.

Backdrop filters are only supported on these browsers: [Link](https://caniuse.com/?search=backdrop-filter)
